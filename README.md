# TicTacToe

Ruby command line tic-tac-toe game.

## About

The tic-tac-toe application accompanies an online tutorial for building object-oriented games with Ruby.  Here is a link to the online tutorial: http://wp.me/p3sWrq-3P

I plan to create a pre work code quiz for this game on my website: http://www.codequizzes.com/

If you have any questions or comments on the application, please feel free to send me a pull request or an email.

## Troubleshooting
If the tests are failing on your local machine because of deprecated methods or other RSpec errors, RSpec documentation can be found at [rspec.info](https://rspec.info/documentation/) (recommended) or [relishapp.com/rspec](https://relishapp.com/rspec)
